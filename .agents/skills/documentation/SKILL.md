# Documentation

Create concise, user-friendly documentation and templates for developers and end users.

## Workflow
1. Identify the audience and required sections.
2. Draft content using consistent terminology.
3. Add examples and usage instructions.
4. Review for clarity and completeness.
5. Follow `.editorconfig` rules for documentation files.
6. Keep prose sentences on a single line, but insert new lines for structure (headings, list items, tables, block quotes, code fences, and paragraph breaks).
7. Split multi-item label lines into separate lines (e.g., label blocks like "**Type**:" and "**Purpose**:" or handoff entries like "**PM → SE**:" should each be on their own line).
8. Keep list item markers and their content on the same line (avoid splitting the marker from its text).
9. Keep checklist items and footer metadata on separate lines (e.g., multiple ✅ items or separate "*Last Updated:*" and "*Version:*" lines should not be merged).
10. Keep Q/A pairs on separate lines (question line, then answer line).
11. Put image markdown and its caption on separate lines (image first, caption line below).
12. Keep technical/code output readable: multi-line JSON objects, multi-line header/body sections, and preserve multiline code blocks without inlining.
