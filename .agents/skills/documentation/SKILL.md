# Documentation

Create concise, user-friendly documentation and templates for developers and end users.

## Workflow
1. Identify the audience and required sections.
2. Draft content using consistent terminology.
3. Add examples and usage instructions.
4. Review for clarity and completeness.
5. Follow `.editorconfig` rules for documentation files.
6. Keep prose sentences on a single line, but insert new lines for structure (headings, list items, tables, block quotes, code fences, and paragraph breaks).
7. Split multi-item label lines into separate lines (e.g., "**Type**:", "**Purpose**:" blocks or "**PM → SE**:" handoff entries should each be on their own line).

## Output Format
- Documentation draft
- Gaps or follow-up items

## References
- [Style guide and README template](references/style-guide.md)
