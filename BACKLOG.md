# Backlog

## In Progress (This PR)
- Userscript: consolidate storage key generation and group helper utilities under a shared `utils` namespace.
- Userscript: bundle sync UI callbacks into a single `syncUi` state object.
- Userscript/Workers: remove legacy sync/auth support (password-hash headers and legacy stored keys).
- Workers: refactor routing to a route table and centralize JSON parsing + config normalization.
- Workers: align auth helpers under grouped exports for clearer usage in request handling.

## Planned
- Follow-up review of sync UI messages for clarity after legacy removal.
