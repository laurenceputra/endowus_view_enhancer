# UX Accessibility

Use this skill when reviewing or implementing UI/visual changes.

## Checklist
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard.
   - Focus order is logical and visible.

2. **Focus States**
   - Focus outlines are visible and not removed without replacement.
   - Modal/dialog focus is trapped appropriately (if applicable).

3. **Contrast & Readability**
   - Text and controls have sufficient contrast against backgrounds.
   - Color is not the only indicator of state (use text or icons too).

4. **ARIA & Semantics**
   - Use semantic elements where possible (buttons, labels, headings).
   - Provide ARIA labels for icon-only controls.

5. **Motion & Animations**
   - Avoid excessive motion; consider reduced-motion preferences.
