## Core-Satellite Portfolio Tracking, Done Right

Endowus Portfolio Viewer is built for investors who structure their wealth with intention. Whether you run a classic core-satellite strategy or a disciplined asset allocation plan, this userscript turns your Endowus dashboard into a purpose-first view of your portfolio.

It groups your goals by real-life outcomes — retirement, education, emergency funds, or any other life milestone — so you can see how each goal maps to your core and satellite holdings at a glance.

## Support for Multiple Goals and Allocation Styles

- **Goal-based clarity:** Keep multiple goals organized without spreadsheets or manual rollups.
- **Core + satellite aligned:** See long-term core holdings and tactical satellites side-by-side within each life goal.
- **Asset allocation visibility:** CPF, SRS, and cash investments show together with clear return and growth indicators.
- **Privacy first:** All data stays on your device and is processed locally in the browser.
- **Zero friction:** Use the "Bucket Name - Description" naming pattern in Endowus and the script does the rest.

## Why This View Matters

Most dashboards group by product or account type. This viewer groups by intent. That means your strategy — not Endowus' default layout — is what you evaluate.

- **Purpose-led investing:** Every goal is tracked with its own core-satellite balance.
- **Better decisions faster:** Identify imbalances, underweight satellites, or overexposed cores within seconds.
- **Made for Singapore investors:** A clean overlay built around Endowus' local workflow and account types.
