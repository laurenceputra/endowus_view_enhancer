## Finally, Your Portfolio Organized By What Actually Matters

Stop guessing. Endowus Portfolio Viewer is the upgrade Singapore investors have been waiting for—a browser overlay that gives you control and perspective you won't get from spreadsheets or default dashboards.

**Own your story.** Group every goal—Retirement, Education, Emergency, and more—into clear, custom buckets, so you always know exactly where you stand and what's on track.

## Private, Beautiful, and Built for Real-Life Strategies

- **Buckets, Not Just Lists:** Go beyond account totals. Instantly see your investments grouped by the goals and priorities that matter to you.
- **No More Blind Spots:** Track CPF, SRS, and cash in one glance, with growth and returns color-coded for confidence.
- **Modern Interface:** Enjoy a responsive, distraction-free overlay with gorgeous gradients and instant access. Portfolio summary or drilldown, always just a click away.
- **Your Data Stays Private:** Runs 100% in your browser—your financial info never leaves your device. No hidden uploads. No third-party analytics. No surprises.
- **Zero Setup, Immediate Clarity:** Just add the script to Tampermonkey, log in to Endowus, and your customized dashboard appears. Grouping takes care of itself if your goal names follow the simple “Bucket - Description” pattern.

## Why Switch? Because Your Portfolio Is Unique

Most platforms treat everyone's investments the same. Endowus Portfolio Viewer puts your planning first:
- **Own Your Category:** The only Singapore tool that overlays your Endowus dashboard and turns generic goal lists into a strategic, bucketed portfolio "map".
- **Radically Simple, Ruthlessly Focused:** No bloated features, no sign-up, no privacy nightmares. Your goals, your strategy, your device.
- **For Core-Satellite Thinkers:** Built from the ground up for investors who manage by intent, not just by instrument—see if you're under- or over-exposed in any life goal, at any moment.
